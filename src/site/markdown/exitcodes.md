# Client Exit Codes

Here are the exit codes returned 

Exit code values 1 and 2 are interpreted by YARN -in particular converting the
"1" value from an error into a successful shut down. Slider
converts the -1 error code from a forked process into `EXIT_MASTER_PROCESS_FAILED`;
no. 72.

## Other exit codes

YARN itself can fail containers, here are some of the causes we've seen


    143: Appears to be triggered by the container exceeding its cgroup memory
    limits
