# Hoya Release 0.9.0

January 2014

This release is built against the Apache Hadoop 2.2.0 and hbase 0.96.0-hadoop2
artifacts. 


## Key changes

### CLI `monitor` action dropped

The monitioring logic has moved into the Application Master, where it will
ultimately monitor the liveness of the deployed service -for Hoya to react
to.

### Freeze command failes with ` EXIT_UNKNOWN_HOYA_CLUSTER = 70` on an unknown cluster

An attempt to freeze an unknown cluster now fails with the error code 70:

    hoya freeze no_such_cluster

### `freeze --force` force kills a hung AM

If an AM is hung, the normal freeze command fails; the `--force` option
avoids talking to the AM and just asks YARN to terminate the application.

    hoya freeze mycluster --force

### `env.MALLOC_ARENA_MAX` added to all roles by default

When the template roles are created, `env.MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=4`
is set for them. This addresses an issue with linux that can cause
containers to fail to start.


### cluster `original/` directory renamed `snapshot`

In earler releases, a copy of the supplied configuration directory was made
into the directory `~/.hoya/clusters/$CLUSTERNAME/original`. This
has caused a bit of confusion during diagnostic emails. We've renamed it
`snapshot` to make clear it is a snapshot of the original configuration directory.
