# Release Process

Here is our release process.

### Before you begin

Check out the latest version of the develop branch,
run the tests. This should be done on a checked out
version of the code that is not the one you are developing on
(ideally, a clean VM), to ensure that you aren't releasing a slightly
modified version of your own, and that you haven't accidentally
included passwords or other test run details into the build resource
tree.

The `slider-funtest` functional test package is used to run functional
tests against a running Hadoop YARN cluster. It needs to be configured
according to the instructions in [testing](testing.html) to
create HBase and Accumulo clusters in the YARN cluster.

*Make sure that the functional tests are passing (and not being skipped) before
starting to make a release*



**Step #1:** Create a JIRA for the release, estimate 3h
(so you don't try to skip the tests)

    export SLIDER_RELEASE_JIRA=BUG-13927
    
**Step #2:** Check everything in. Git flow won't let you progress without this.

**Step #3:** Git flow: create a release branch

    export SLIDER_RELEASE=0.5.2
    
    git flow release start slider-$SLIDER_RELEASE

**Step #4:** in the new branch, increment those version numbers using (the maven
versions plugin)[http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/]

    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$SLIDER_RELEASE


**Step #5:** commit the changed POM files
  
    git add <changed files>
    git commit -m "$SLIDER_RELEASE_JIRA updating release POMs for $SLIDER_RELEASE"

  
**Step #6:** Do a final test run to make sure nothing is broken

In the `slider` directory, run:

    mvn clean test

This will run the functional tests as well as the `slider-core` tests.

It is wise to reset any VMs here, and on live clusters kill all running jobs.
This stops functional tests failing because the job doesn't get started before
the tests time out.


**Step #7:** Build the release package

Run
    
    mvn clean site:site site:stage package 

As the test run takes 30-60+ minutes, now is a good time to consider
finalizing the release notes.


**Step #8:** validate the Tar

Look in `slider-assembly/target` to find the `.tar.gz` file, and the
expanded version of it. Inspect that expanded version to make sure that
everything looks good -and that the versions of all the dependent artifacts
look good too: there must be no `-SNAPSHOT` dependencies.


**Step #9:** Build the release notes

Create a a one-line plain text release note for commits and tags
And a multi-line markdown release note, which will be used for artifacts.


    Release against hadoop 2.3.0, HBase-0.98.0 and Accumulo 1.5.1 artifacts. 

The multi-line release notes should go into `slider/src/site/markdown/release_notes`.


These should be committed

    git add --all
    git commit -m "$SLIDER_RELEASE_JIRA updating release notes"

**Step #10:** End the git flow

Finish the git flow release, either in the SourceTree GUI or
the command line:

    
    git flow release finish slider-$SLIDER_RELEASE
    

On the command line you have to enter the one-line release description
prepared earlier.

You will now be back on the `develop` branch.

**Step #11:** update mvn versions

Switch back to `develop` and update its version number past
the release number


    export SLIDER_RELEASE=0.6.0-SNAPSHOT
    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$SLIDER_RELEASE
    git commit -a -m "$SLIDER_RELEASE_JIRA updating development POMs to $SLIDER_RELEASE"

**Step #12:** Push the release and develop branches to github 

    git push origin master develop 

(assuming that `origin` maps to `git@github.com:hortonworks/hoya.git`;
 you can check this with `git remote -v`


The `git-flow` program automatically pushes up the `release/slider-X.Y` branch,
before deleting it locally.

If you are planning on any release work of more than a single test run,
consider having your local release branch track the master.


**Step #13:** ### Release on github small artifacts

Browse to https://github.com/hortonworks/slider/releases/new

Create a new release on the site by following the instructions

Files under 5GB can be published directly. Otherwise, follow step 14

**Step #14:**  For releasing via an external CDN (e.g. Rackspace Cloud)

Using the web GUI for your particular distribution network, upload the
`.tar.gz` artifact

After doing this, edit the release notes on github to point to the
tar file's URL.

Example: 
    [Download slider-0.10.1-all.tar.gz](http://dffeaef8882d088c28ff-185c1feb8a981dddd593a05bb55b67aa.r18.cf1.rackcdn.com/slider-0.10.1-all.tar.gz)

**Step #15:** Announce the release 

**Step #16:** Finish the JIRA

Log the time, close the issue. This should normally be the end of a 
sprint -so wrap that up too.

**Step #17:** Get back to developing!

Check out the develop branch and purge all release artifacts

    git checkout develop
    git pull origin
    mvn clean
