# Setting up for Agent test

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

      RFC 2119.

An agent is an application independent entity that can handle any application as long as its definition conforms to a specific format (TBD). While Slider will install the agent in its entirity, for now the host, where the agent is deployed, needs to be prepared for the agent. The following steps are necessary to setup the host for agent.

## Install resource management library
The resource management library is a common python library used by all application specification. The library is either pre-installed on the hosts or it is packaged along with the application package itself.
 
Get resource_management.tar and install it at /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

## Install the application spec
The application spec is the declarative definition of a application that can be run on YARN. *At this point only HBase application is supported.*

Get HDP-2.0.6.tar and install at /var/lib/ambari-agent/cache/stacks/HDP.

## Install HBase using tarball
Get the hbase tarball, hbase-0.96.1-hadoop2-bin.tar.tar.tar.gz, and expand it at /share/hbase.

## Permissions
Ensure that the user creating the hbase cluster has necessary permission for the resource management library and the application spec. Perform necessary **chown** and **chmod**.

1. /share/hbase/hbase-0.96.1-hadoop2/conf
2. /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/resource_management
3. /var/lib/ambari-agent/cache/stacks/HDP
4. /var/log/hbase, /var/run/hbase (or appropriate log and run directories)
5. Ensure hbase root/staging HDFS directories have appropriate permission
