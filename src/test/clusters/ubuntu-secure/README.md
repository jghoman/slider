This is a set of configurations for a single-node YARN cluster running in
a VM, with HDFS and YARN brought up on the external network, not localhost.
Assuming the physical host has a DNS entry for the machine, *ubuntu*, 
a Hoya Client running on the host can upload Hoya and deploy HBase onto
the single-node cluster even though neither is installed on the VM.
